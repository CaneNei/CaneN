export const aboutme1 = `Hi, my name is Cane Neilson, and I am a programmer interested in game development, software development, and game design.'},
I am from Australia and Japan, speaking both languages, and love everything about programming.
I first began learning about computers and programming through Minecraft modding and was instantly drawn into it.
I found a passion that involved designing and creating small games that my friends and I could play.
As a child, I would create games in my notebook at school and would challenge friends to play with me.
Personally, I see myself as both a games designer and games programmer thoroughly enjoying both aspects.`;

export const aboutme2 = `I love learning about new concepts and ideas, recently picking up React and CSS to create this very website in front of you.
Below are some projects I worked on, that showcase my game development and UX skill.`;

export const aboutme3 =`I believe in pursuing perfection, so I always aim to iterate through my code to create a clean and fast running game.
I am open to working on a wide range of projects and hope to create amazing, successful games that I can be proud.
