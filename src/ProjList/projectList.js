The aim for this game was to create a chaotic short shmup that was unlike other games in the same genre. It was built for PC and uses the players mouse and keyboard to defeat 4 different enemy types consuming their health on death. Ultimately until the player reached the boss in an intense final battle.
    Developing this game, I found that Unity was an extensive game engine that could be used to create a wide variety of games. In addition to this, I learnt the basics of unity and how the architecture of a game should be built.
